# ReadMe Generator

# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

## Our Task

Our task was to create a ReadMe generator using Node.js and through the Inquirer Package

As per the acceptance criteria we needed to have our index.js ask the user to input certain info like Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, License, Badge, GitHub Username and the users email.

Once they the readme had been set up, needed to make sure in had links in a table of contents and those links took the user to the correct area.

## Summary

Overall by completing this weeks Mini Project it was able to allow me to convert that knowledge into this project and I dont think I wouldve been able to do it without the Mini Project and the help of classmates and tutors during that time we were allocated to complete it.
